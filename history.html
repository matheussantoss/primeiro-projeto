In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other electronics. <br> The version history of the Android mobile operating system began with the public release of the Android beta in November 5, 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. Android is continually developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance, and it has seen a number of updates to its base operating system since the initial release.</p>

            <p>Sears was a student in the Interactive Telecommunication Program at New York University. His list of creations range from writing a mobile messaging framework to building a DC-DC switching voltage regulator. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller's 1962 proposal for the Geoscope, which called for "a 200-foot-diameter sphere covered with 10 million computer-controlled light sources to be suspended over the East River in full view of the United Nations, Sears and his father created their own orb using the  persistence of vision and LEDs to create a bright display with a three-dimensional effect using far fewer light sources.</p>
